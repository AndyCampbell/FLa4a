\description{
  Class definition (slots), constructors, accessors,
  replacement (when relevant) and common methods.
}
\note{
  This class is similar to other 'plural' calsses in
  \code{FLR}. It's a list constraint by having all elements
  of the same class, in this case \code{submodel}.
  Otherwise it works exacly as any other list.
}
\section{Constructor}{
  A construction method exists for this class that can take
  named arguments for any of its slots. All slots are then
  created to match the requirements of the class validity.
  If an unnamed \code{FLQuant} object is provided, this is
  used for sizing but not stored in any slot.
